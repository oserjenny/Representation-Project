## Introduction

This file documents the data cleaning for the Representation Project

## Data cleaning

Read in the data.
```{r}
tbl<-read_rds("../Data/cumulative_2006_2017.Rds")
```

Take a look at the data
```{r} 
head(tbl)
```

Look at all variable names in file
```{r} 
names(tbl)
```

Select variables (example from Kuriwaki Guide)
```{r}
tbl %>%
  select(year, case_id, pid3)
```

Note from Kuriwaki guide (p.3) - A labelled variable's labels are not shown immediately in the console, as is clear from output of previous chunk. But labels can be displayed by transforming the labelled vector into a factor.

library(haven)
select(tbl, year, case_id, pid3) %>% 
  mutate(pid3_fct = as_factor(pid3))

Select variables (example from Kuriwaki Guide)
```{r}
tbl %>%
  select(year, case_id, pid3)
```


Display frequencies of validated turnout General Election over time 
```{r} 
tbl %>% 
  group_by (year) %>% 
  count (vv_turnout_gvm) 
```

Display table - frequencies of validated turnout General Election over time
```{r, eval=FALSE} 
tbl %>% 
  group_by (year) %>% 
  count (vv_turnout_gvm) %>% 
  View
```

Recode of vv_turnout_gvm to dichotomous
```{r} 
tbl <- tbl %>%
  mutate(vv_turnout_gvm_binary=as.numeric(vv_turnout_gvm=="Voted"))
```

Display frequencies of recoded Validated turnout General Election over time 
```{r} 
tbl %>% 
  group_by (year) %>% 
  count (vv_turnout_gvm_binary) 
```

Display table, frequencies of recoded Validated turnout General Election over time 
```{r,eval=FALSE} 
tbl %>% 
  group_by (year) %>% 
  count (vv_turnout_gvm_binary) %>% 
  View
```

Plot turnout dichotomous by year
```{r} 
ggplot(tbl,aes(x=year,y=vv_turnout_gvm_binary))

```

...Didn't work - began drafting revised code w JA
```{r} 
ggplot(tbl,aes(x=year,y=vv_turnout_gvm_binary)) geom_bar

```

JO attempted new coding based on Grolemund & Wickham - nope
```{r} 
ggplot(data = tbl)
 geom_point(mapping = aes(x=year,y=vv_turnout_gvm_binary))
```

```{r}

```

```{r}

geom_point()
```

```{r}

```

```{r} 
ggplot(tbl)
geom_point(mapping = aes(x=year, y=vv_turnout_gvm_binary))

```

JO exploring additional vars in dataset
Year
```{r} 
tbl %>% 
  count (year) 
```

tookpost - "Whether or not the respondent took the post-election wave of the survey (in even years)"
```{r} 
tbl %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  count(tookpost) 
```

Weight - year-specific for all years, see Kuriwaki p.7 for notes
```{r} 
tbl %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  count(weight) 
```

Weight - cumulative. Includes simple adjustment of multiplying a constant within year to make years comparable.
```{r} 
tbl %>% 
  group_by(year) %>% 
  count(weight_cumulative) 
```

Geographic variables
*State - imputed from input zipcode
```{r} 
tbl %>% 
  count(state) 
```

Geographic variables
*St - same data as "State", Var name = 2-letter State abbreviation
```{r} 
tbl %>% 
  count(st) 
```

Geographic variables
*cd: Congressional district in current Congress
```{r} 
tbl %>% 
  count(state) 
```

Gender
```{r} 
tbl %>% 
  count(gender) 
```
